# Dijkstra
Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding in Unity3D.
This implementation checks all possible movements within a given radius taking different movement costs into account,
but it could easily be adapted for it's use as a fastest route pathfinding system.
It contains a system to allow movement in multiple floors through ramps or inclinations, it is already working but still
experimental.
